                            <p>Comedy has been around for years, and has gone through many phases of evolution.
                            However, some say you can't beat the original style. <br>
                            There are many opportunities to see a good comedy show in a classic, 
                                club setting. You could visit:<br>

                                <p>Maybe the club scene isn't your thing. You'd like to be able to say
                                    you saw Kyle Kinane and Lana Del Rey on the same stage (not 
                                    at the same time, that would be weird).<br>In that case, you should
                                    check out an independently booked show. This could happen anywhere:<br>
                                    <ul>

                                    The possibilities are endless!

                                <p>"But Sam!", you say. "I've seen plenty of shows at concert halls and 
                                    comedy clubs. I just want to go hang out at a comfortable bar somewhere
                                    and chill. Too bad they can't do comedy at a bar." Oh sweet, sweet reader.
                                    You can see awesome independent shows at bars in St. Louis every night of 
                                    the week!:<br>

                                        a lot of great comedy happening in St. Louis. I would love to see
                                        a show. It would also be cool if someone I knew was going to be on it."
