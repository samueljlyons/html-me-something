                            <p id="intro">When many people think about cities known for comedy, their thoughts migrate 
                                to New York City, LA, and Chicago.But what if I told you that there is grade a comedy to
                                be seen within a 10-mile radius of the Arch? St. Louis has long been
                                a destination for those interested in great comedy. From clubs rich with 
                                history to independent bar shows, and everything in between, you can find a good
                                laugh in the Lou. "That sounds preposterous", you might say? Well, get ready 
                                to be amazed.

                            <p>Comedy has been around for years, and has gone through many phases of evolution. 
                                However, some say you can't beat the original style. Show up with your ticket, and be 
                                escorted to your seat by an usher. You're so close to the stage, you could reach out and touch
                                the performer. Please don't though, without their explicit consent. <br>
                            There are many opportunities to see a good comedy show in a classic, 
                                club setting. You could visit:<br>

                                <p>Maybe the club scene isn't your thing. You'd like to be able to say
                                    you saw Kyle Kinane and Lana Del Rey on the same stage (not 
                                    at the same time, that would be weird).<br>In that case, you should
                                    check out an independently booked show. This could happen anywhere:<br>

                                    comedy clubs. I just want to go hang out at a comfortable bar somewhere
                                    and chill. Too bad they can't do comedy at a bar." Oh sweet, sweet reader.
                                    You can see awesome independent shows at bars in St. Louis every night of
